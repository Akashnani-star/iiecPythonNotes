Session 1 :
	speak is a function present in pyttsx3 module
	import pyttsx3
	pyttsx3.speak("hii")

Session 2:
	how to read all data in RAM??
	the code when loaded on the RAM it is known as process not program.
	REPL -> Read Evaluate Print Loop.
	y = [1,2,3,4,5]
	y[3] can also be y.__getitem__(3)
	y[:4] from start to 4
	y[3:] from 3 to last
	y[3:251245124] from 3 to last.
	import numpy as np
	ar = np.array(we have to pass a list as argument)
	ar = np.array([1,2,3]).
	import os 
	os.system("[command]") like -> os.system("cls")

Session 3:
	how to whatsapp,sms,email using Python?
	command for opening jupyter -->  jupyter notebook
	shift+Enter to execute present cell
	esc+d+d will delete the cell
	press tab two times for methods autocompletion.
	print(r'akash \t akashnani') --->  prints (akash \t akashnani)

Session 4:
	alt+enter to run and create new cell in jupyter.

Session 5:
	We have to run WebServer in ubuntu with command systemctl start apache2
	we have to place our html files in /var/www/html
	we can access html files in this folder by http://[ip-address]/[html-file]
	we have to place our codefiles like python files in /lib/cgi-bin/
	But we have change the url while running the python files by web
	http://[ip-address]/cgi-bin/pythonFile
	we have to make the python files as executable bcoz we are not running the code
	the server is running.. ---> chmod +x [python-file]
	we have to say which interpreter to use to run the code --> #!python3 --> #![intepreter] (#! is hashBang)
	But we have to give the interpreter location(url) where it is present in the system  like ---> #!/usr/bin/python3
	we have to tell our python code to print our output in browser by telling the content type in response,
	content-type : text/html ---> means we are sending Text and Browser have to display in html in format
	
	Conclusion:
		step 1: we have to place our code in /lib/cgi-bin/
		step 2: we have make our file as executable
		step 3: we have to place hashbang at top of the file
		step 4: we have to tell content-type as text/html and print a new line to seperate header and body

	os module will not return output it will print automatically
	To get output to us without printing we can use the function getoutput present in subprocess module
	import subprocess
	subprocess.getoutput("date")
	API means we are giving our python program as interface to client so it is known as Application Program Interface
