Session 1 :
	speak is a function present in pyttsx3 module
	import pyttsx3
	pyttsx3.speak("hii")

Session 2:
	how to read all data in RAM??
	the code when loaded on the RAM it is known as process not program.
	REPL -> Read Evaluate Print Loop.
	y = [1,2,3,4,5]
	y[3] can also be y.__getitem__(3)
	y[:4] from start to 4
	y[3:] from 3 to last
	y[3:251245124] from 3 to last.
	import numpy as np
	ar = np.array(we have to pass a list as argument)
	ar = np.array([1,2,3]).
	import os 
	os.system("[command]") like -> os.system("cls")

Session 3:
	how to whatsapp,sms,email using Python?
	command for opening jupyter -->  jupyter notebook
	shift+Enter to execute present cell
	esc+d+d will delete the cell
	press tab two times for methods autocompletion.
	print(r'akash \t akashnani') --->  prints (akash \t akashnani)

Session 4:
	alt+enter to run and create new cell in jupyter.

Session 5:
	We have to run WebServer in ubuntu with command systemctl start apache2
	we have to place our html files in /var/www/html
	we can access html files in this folder by http://[ip-address]/[html-file]
	we have to place our codefiles like python files in /lib/cgi-bin/
	But we have change the url while running the python files by web
	http://[ip-address]/cgi-bin/pythonFile
	we have to make the python files as executable bcoz we are not running the code
	the server is running.. ---> chmod +x [python-file]
	we have to say which interpreter to use to run the code --> #!python3 --> #![intepreter] (#! is hashBang)
	But we have to give the interpreter location(url) where it is present in the system  like ---> #!/usr/bin/python3
	we have to tell our python code to print our output in browser by telling the content type in response,
	content-type : text/html ---> means we are sending Text and Browser have to display in html in format
	
	Conclusion:
		step 1: we have to place our code in /lib/cgi-bin/
		step 2: we have make our file as executable
		step 3: we have to place hashbang at top of the file
		step 4: we have to tell content-type as text/html and print a new line to seperate header and body

	os module will not return output it will print automatically
	To get output to us without printing we can use the function getoutput present in subprocess module
	import subprocess
	subprocess.getoutput("date")
	API means we are giving our python program as interface to client so it is known as Application Program Interface
	
Session 6:
	free -m  --->> command used to know the amount of ram free
	The Function or method which is used to take input from the client is FieldStorage() from module cgi
	import cgi
	data = cgi.FiledStorage()
	we can fetch the values of data send through the method getvalue("[dataname]")
	name = data.getvalue("name")
	password = data.getvalue("password")
	radio button can store only one value at a time bcoz it is just a variable
	checkbox can store more than one value at a time bcoz it is a list
Session 7:
	if we send location : [url] in the header part of response then our page will redirect to specified url
	curl http:www.google.com --->  command line interface for viewing website
	curl -I http:www.google.com ---> will print header of that response
	import subprocess as sp
	sp.getstatusoutput("cmd")  ---> will give output as tuple of status of the command and output of the command sp.getstatusoutput("ipconfig")   ----> output is (status(0|1),output)
	how to display gui programs of server in client browser?

Session 8:
	we have a module called webbrowser
	import webbrowser	 as wb
	wb.open([url])
	pyaudio is library we used to connect our python code with mic of our system
	pip install pyaudio will not works use "conda install pyaudio"
	"speechrecognition" is the library which can interact with the api of google voice recoginition api.
	first we have to import "speech_recognition" module for recognising our speech
	import speech_recognition as sr
	"with" keyword is used for connecting and closing the connection
	for adding microphone usage to our program we have to first initialize the class called Recognizer which is present in speech_recognition
	r = sr.Recognizer()
	now we have to open mike for that we have Microphone function speech_recognition module sr.Microphone() we use that source
	This Microphone() will use PyAudio module internally.
	with sr.Microphone() as source:
	now we have to listen to the voice coming from the source for that we have method listen in class Recognizer it will return the recorded audio
	audio = r.listen(source)
	then we have to decode the voice and make it to string for that we will use google API for that we have a method called recoginze_google() in Recognizer 
	textOfOurSpeech = r.recoginze_google(audio)
	that's all
	final code is 
	###     Code  for  voice  recognition   ###
	import speech_recognition as sr
	r = sr.Recognizer()
	with sr.Microphone() as source:
		print("start say")
		audio = r.listen(source)
	textOfOurSpeech = r.recoginze_google(audio)
	print(textOfOurSpeech)

	#######################################
Session 9:
	in python we have a function called getpass() in module getpass to take inputs of passwords without echoback
	import getpass as gp
	password = gp.getpass()
	some commands don't show output but we can know whether they are succesful or not
	if our command is succesful 0 is get stored in global variable called ?
	echo $?
	if value is not 0 then previous command is failed.
	why tuple is created?

Session 10:
	Integrating python and docker using cgi
	we can put variables inside string like  ---> "hi this {} x variable value".format(x)
	x = 10,y=20
	"this is {1} and {1} data".format(x,y) --->  "this is 20 and 20 data"
	"this is {0} and {0} data".format(x) --->  "this is 10 and 10 data"
	"this is {1} and {0} data".format(x,y) --->  "this is 20 and 10 data"
	actually we use the following command to run docker container 
	syntax : docker run -it --name [container-name] [image/or-name]:[version]
	example : docker run -it --name akash centos:7
	but above command will lead to interactive with another os but python can't do that
	so we use -d to create and detach docker container detach means not making interact with that container the container will run in background
	syntax : so the command is docker run -dit --name [container-name] [image/or-name]:[version]
	example : docker run -dit --name akash centos:7
	
	so final code is 
	import cgi
	import subprocess as sp
	formValues = cgi.FieldStorage()
	dockerName = formValues.getvalue("dockerName")
	op = sp.getstatusoutput("docker run -dit --name {0} centos:7".format(dockerName))
	if(op[0] == 0):
		print("Created a container named {0}",dockerName);
	else:
		print("some error occured {0}",op[1]);
	But the following code don't work we have to use sudo while running the docker command
	that will be explained in next session

Session 11:
	We have to problems while integrating python with Docker
	1. SELinux --> setenforce 0
	2. we have to use sudo
	we have to use sudo bcoz apache is webserver which will run our python codes
	but internally it uses a normal user of that os named apache to run our code
	a normal user doesn't have power to run some advanced commands which need permissions so we give all powers to the user apache 
	to give root power to apache user we have to edit in /etc/sudoers file
	and after the line root ALL=(ALL) ALL
	we have to write 
	apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
	now we have to tell our apache that we have sudo power but we have to use sudo infront of our commands
	example : sudo docker run -it --name akash centos:7
	Final conclusion : 
		step 1 : we have to give all permissions to the apache user in /etc/sudoers file 
		            apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
		step 2: we have to use sudo in our commands
	useradd [username]  ----> will create a user
	id [username]   ------>  checks whether the user exist or not
	We can use select tag for droppable selection
	<select name="image">
		<option>ubuntu:14.04</option>
		<option>centos:7</option>
		<option>centos:latest</option>
	</select>
	selected item will store in variable image.

Session 12:
	How for loop stops automatically?
	
	1.
		x = [1,2,3,4,5]
		y = []
		for i in x:
			y.append(i*i)
		
		List Comprehension:
		[destination_list] = [business logic for i in some list]
		y = [i*i for i in x]
	
	2.
		x = [1,2,3,4,5]
		y = []
		for i in x:
			if i>0:
				y.append(i*i)
		
		List Comprehension:
		[destination_list] = [business logic for i in some list if_condition on i]
		y = [i*i for i in x if i>0]

	3..
		x = [1,2,3,4,5]
		y = []
		for i in x:
			if i>0:
				j = i*i
				y.append(j)
			else:
				j = "Not supported variable"
				y.append(j)
		
		List Comprehension:
		[destination_list] = [business_logic if_condition on i else what is value of business logic for i in some list]
		y = [i*i if i>0 else "Not supported variable" for i in x]

	No.of Arguments:		
	-------------------
	def func(*i):
		print(i)

	func(1,3,2,45,23,6,23,56)
	func(1,2,4,6)
	
	output:
	(1,3,2,45,23,6,23,56)
	(1,2,4,6)
	
	i will be tuple all arguments passed will store in a single tuple
		
Session 13:
	DataSet means whole table in data Collection
	on the data we can do 3 things
	1. query   --->   querying about a feature of one record/user ---> performed row wise
	2. data analysis  --->    perfoming some action like counting no.of tuples   ----> guy who tdo data analysis is known as  data analyst.
	can be done on the data which is already collected.  ---->  performed column wise.
	3. data analystics   --->   any data which is not present but we try to predict the data

	
Session 14:
	import numpy as np
	a = np.array([1,2,3])
	shape is filed of that array named a
	a.shape  ---->   (3,)    ----->   It means it has only column with 3 rows

 	a = numpy.array([["akash",1],["nani",2],["dhanvi",3],["veera",4]]) 
	a.shape ---->  (4,2)   ------>  4rows   2columns

	arra3 = numpy.array([["akash",1,"a@gmial.com"],["nani",2,"b@gmial.com"],["dhanvi",3,"c@gmial.com"],["veera",4,"d@gmial.com"]])
	a.shape ---->  (4,3)   ------>  4rows   3columns
	
	1dimension array is also known as "Vector".
	
	arra3[:,1]  --->   ['1','2','3','4']  --->  to conver them into integers  ----> intArray = arra3[:,1].astype(int)

	s.dtype will return the datatype of the array

	if we have more columns in data it will become so hard while counting the column indices and performing operations. so we move to pandas

	But we can give field name in numpy also.
	the data we tell about column name and column data type is known as metadata.
	
	import pandas as ps
	p = ps.read_csv("[csv-file-name]")
	print(p['column-name'])
	if we want to retrieve more columns we have to create list of that columns
	print(p[['column-name1','column-name2']])
	
	for row wise operationas we have use 
	p.iloc[<row-number>]
	p.iloc[1]

	type(p) is DataFrame

Session 15:
