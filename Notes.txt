Session 1 :
	speak is a function present in pyttsx3 module
	import pyttsx3
	pyttsx3.speak("hii")

Session 2:
	how to read all data in RAM??
	the code when loaded on the RAM it is known as process not program.
	REPL -> Read Evaluate Print Loop.
	y = [1,2,3,4,5]
	y[3] can also be y.__getitem__(3)
	y[:4] from start to 4
	y[3:] from 3 to last
	y[3:251245124] from 3 to last.
	import numpy as np
	ar = np.array(we have to pass a list as argument)
	ar = np.array([1,2,3]).
	import os 
	os.system("[command]") like -> os.system("cls")

Session 3:
	how to whatsapp,sms,email using Python?
	command for opening jupyter -->  jupyter notebook
	shift+Enter to execute present cell
	esc+d+d will delete the cell
	press tab two times for methods autocompletion.
	print(r'akash \t akashnani') --->  prints (akash \t akashnani)

Session 4:
	alt+enter to run and create new cell in jupyter.

Session 5:
	We have to run WebServer in ubuntu with command systemctl start apache2
	we have to place our html files in /var/www/html
	we can access html files in this folder by http://[ip-address]/[html-file]
	we have to place our codefiles like python files in /lib/cgi-bin/
	But we have change the url while running the python files by web
	http://[ip-address]/cgi-bin/pythonFile
	we have to make the python files as executable bcoz we are not running the code
	the server is running.. ---> chmod +x [python-file]
	we have to say which interpreter to use to run the code --> #!python3 --> #![intepreter] (#! is hashBang)
	But we have to give the interpreter location(url) where it is present in the system  like ---> #!/usr/bin/python3
	we have to tell our python code to print our output in browser by telling the content type in response,
	content-type : text/html ---> means we are sending Text and Browser have to display in html in format
	
	Conclusion:
		step 1: we have to place our code in /lib/cgi-bin/
		step 2: we have make our file as executable
		step 3: we have to place hashbang at top of the file
		step 4: we have to tell content-type as text/html and print a new line to seperate header and body

	os module will not return output it will print automatically
	To get output to us without printing we can use the function getoutput present in subprocess module
	import subprocess
	subprocess.getoutput("date")
	API means we are giving our python program as interface to client so it is known as Application Program Interface
	
Session 6:
	free -m  --->> command used to know the amount of ram free
	The Function or method which is used to take input from the client is FieldStorage() from module cgi
	import cgi
	data = cgi.FiledStorage()
	we can fetch the values of data send through the method getvalue("[dataname]")
	name = data.getvalue("name")
	password = data.getvalue("password")
	radio button can store only one value at a time bcoz it is just a variable
	checkbox can store more than one value at a time bcoz it is a list
Session 7:
	if we send location : [url] in the header part of response then our page will redirect to specified url
	curl http:www.google.com --->  command line interface for viewing website
	curl -I http:www.google.com ---> will print header of that response
	import subprocess as sp
	sp.getstatusoutput("cmd")  ---> will give output as tuple of status of the command and output of the command sp.getstatusoutput("ipconfig")   ----> output is (status(0|1),output)
	how to display gui programs of server in client browser?

Session 8:
	we have a module called webbrowser
	import webbrowser	 as wb
	wb.open([url])
	pyaudio is library we used to connect our python code with mic of our system
	pip install pyaudio will not works use "conda install pyaudio"
	"speechrecognition" is the library which can interact with the api of google voice recoginition api.
	first we have to import "speech_recognition" module for recognising our speech
	import speech_recognition as sr
	"with" keyword is used for connecting and closing the connection
	for adding microphone usage to our program we have to first initialize the class called Recognizer which is present in speech_recognition
	r = sr.Recognizer()
	now we have to open mike for that we have Microphone function speech_recognition module sr.Microphone() we use that source
	with sr.Microphone() as source:
	now we have to listen to the voice coming from the source for that we have method listen in class Recognizer it will return the recorded audio
	audio = r.listen(source)
	then we have to decode the voice and make it to string for that we will use google API for that we have a method called recoginze_google() in Recognizer 
	textOfOurSpeech = r.recoginze_google(audio)
	that's all
	final code is 
	###     Code  for  voice  recognition   ###
	import speech_recognition as sr
	r = sr.Recognizer()
	with sr.Microphone() as source:
		print("start say")
		audio = r.listen(source)
	textOfOurSpeech = r.recoginze_google(audio)
	print(textOfOurSpeech)
